# LinkedList Pointer Jumping

This C++ program demonstrates a linked list with a pointer jumping algorithm. It initializes the list, performs pointer jumping, and displays the modified list.

## Running

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source files.
4. Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
    g++ LinkedList.cpp test.cpp -o test
    ```

5. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./test
    ```
6. You should see the output displaying the initial linked list and the modified list after pointer jumping, followed by a message indicating all tests passed.
